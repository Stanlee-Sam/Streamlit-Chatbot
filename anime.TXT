Anime is a style of animation that originated in Japan. It is known for its colorful artwork, vibrant characters, and imaginative stories. Unlike Western cartoons, anime covers a wide range of genres and can target children, teens, and adults.

Anime as a term comes from the English word animation. In Japan, the word refers to all animated works, but globally it is used to describe Japanese animation specifically.

The history of anime began in the early 1900s with short experimental films. One of the first recognized works is Katsudō Shashin from around 1907. Over time, studios like Toei Animation, Sunrise, Madhouse, and Studio Ghibli helped shape the medium.

Osamu Tezuka is often called the father of anime. His art style, inspired by Disney, introduced expressive eyes and cinematic techniques that influenced generations of creators.

Studio Ghibli is one of the most famous animation studios in the world. Founded by Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata, the studio produced films such as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, My Neighbor Totoro, and Howl’s Moving Castle. Spirited Away won an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.
